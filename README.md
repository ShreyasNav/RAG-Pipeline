# RAG-Pipeline

I used SerpAI for data collection and LangChain to make the vector database
The model ai4b_indicConformer_hi.nemo is used to transcribe hindi audio (its format should be .wav)
MyMemmory API is used for translation 
Cohere's LLM model is used for Text Generation

Instructions for usage:
Download the vector embedding files which are index.faiss and index.pkl (these are pre generated by me) or 
if you want to make yours use data_collection.py to scrape data on prefered topic then get vector database of that by using vector_db.py. You can update an already present vector database with new text's embeddings by using update_vector_db.py
In rag.py put the paths for your .faiss and .pkl files in appropriate line which is given in the code
Use uvicorn rag:app --reload this command to run rag.py and once the application has started succesfully go to the url "http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs#/"
Click on rag-pipeline, click on try it out, upload the audio file in .wav format and click on execute
Refer to demo video for clarity and to review the demonstration of task.
